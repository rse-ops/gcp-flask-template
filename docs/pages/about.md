# About

The Google Cloud + Flask + Stanford template here is the first of many templates that want to make it easy
for you to deploy an application to show off your analysis, paper, or even to
create a programmatic RestFul API for others to use. Brought to you by [Research Software Engineering Services](https://stanford-rc.github.io/rse-services), this is the first of several free-to-use templates that will get you started with a solid base for your development.
